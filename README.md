# Geth collaborator list

**Please submit requests to join the collaborator list [here][form]**.

This repository tracks the list of contributors who are allow to submit pull
requests to the upstream [go-ethereum][geth] repository. We've instituted the
policy to address the major increase in pull request volume, particularly AI and
AI-assisted contributions.

## Rationale

The go-ethereum team maintains a critical piece of Ethereum infrastructure and
security is of utmost importance to us. We review every pull request thoroughly.
Preferably each pull request is reviewed by more than one team member.

It's becoming easier and easier to analyze repositories to find and implement
low-hanging contributions. Think spelling fixes, newer language features, etc.
At the same time, being a registered contributor to go-ethereum is becoming more
valuable due to airdrops. This creates a flywheel of contributors who want
to land patches for personal gain rather in the spirit of moving the project
forward.

While we don't want to completely shut out these types of contributions -- they
are one of the reasons go-ethereum is so great after all -- we needed to find a
new approach. We're optimistic that the new collaborator list system will help
strengthen our relationships with contributors and set an example for how other
open source projects can remain open to contributions from anyone while not
being overrun with opportunistic contributors.

## Code of Conduct

The go-ethereum project is committed to fostering a respectful, collaborative, and productive environment for all contributors. We expect every participant to engage with others courteously, to provide constructive feedback, and to value the time and effort of the community and the team. Only individuals on the `COLLABORATORS` list may submit pull requests, and continued inclusion on this list requires consistently helpful, high-quality engagement. If the go-ethereum team must repeatedly communicate that a contributor’s submissions are misaligned with project needs or are not adding value, that contributor may lose their collaborator status at the team’s discretion. Our goal is to maintain a welcoming space for contributors where we can work together effectively to advance the go-ethereum project.
